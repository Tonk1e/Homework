# Did the Haiti EQ have greater primary effects than Japan's?
## Haiti EQ
### Introduction
On the 12th of January, 2010, at 16:53 local time, an earthquake occurred in Haiti. It reached 7.0 on the richter scale, compared to the 9.0 reached by the Japanese Earthquake and Tsunami on the 11th of March, 2011. Even though 9.0 > 7.0, it may have been a lot harder for Haiti to deal with the effects of the earthquake. When comparing the effects of the two EQs, it almost creates an equilibrium when the ability of the country to recover, and the size of the earthquake, are considered. However, it might not. What if this equation proves that the effects were greater on Haiti? Well, let's find out.
### Primary and Secondary Impacts
Before I begin, I need to define what a Primary and a Secondary impact is. A primary impact is a direct result of the earthquake, while a secondary impact that comes with, or is caused by, a primary impact. For example, if someone got killed by the earthquake, that would be a primary impact. A secondary impact would be, for example, that it may make that person's family very emotional.
### Economic Impact
As I pointed out earlier, Haiti isn't nearly as economically developed as Japan. As a result of this, or you might say primary impact, is that they are less able to put safety protocols in place, given that they require expensive resources. However, Japan is more than capable of this, and that may mean that the effects of this may render Haiti incapable of dealing with the earthquake as well as Japan. So, when Haiti does try to combat the earthquake, or at least clean up after it, they may be forced to spend money that they don't necessarily have. This could put Haiti in a lot of debt, and their economy would be left even worse than it was in the first place. This may result in Haiti's government being unable to invest in areas such as healthcare, education, public transport, etc. This is a secondary impact. Let me explain why. Property being destroyed is a primary impact of the earthquake, and the fact that they have to pay for repairations comes with it. Thus meaning that it is a secondary impact as it comes as a result of a primary impact.
