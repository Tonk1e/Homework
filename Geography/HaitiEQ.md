# Did the Haiti EQ have greater primary effects than Japan's?
## Haiti EQ
### Introduction
On the 12th of January, 2010, at 16:53 local time, an earthquake occurred in Haiti. It reached 7.0 on the richter scale, compared to the 9.0 reached by the Japanese Earthquake and Tsunami on the 11th of March, 2011. Even though 9.0 > 7.0, it may have been a lot harder for Haiti to deal with the effects of the earthquake. When comparing the effects of the two EQs, it almost creates an equilibrium when the ability of the country to recover, and the size of the earthquake, are considered. However, it might not. What if this equation proves that the effects were greater on Haiti? Well, let's find out.
